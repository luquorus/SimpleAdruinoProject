## About

This repository is a compilation of mini projects that I have completed while learning Arduino. These projects serve as a practical application of the concepts and skills acquired throughout my studies. The projects range from basic to intermediate levels, each focusing on different aspects of hardware and software integration using Arduino.

## Projects

Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Simple Smart Trash** 
2. **IRremote Controlled LED**
3. 

(Feel free to add more projects as you continue your learning journey!)

## Requirements

To run the projects in this repository, you will need:

- An Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega)
- USB cable to connect Arduino to your computer
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- Various electronic components (specified in each project's folder)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-mini-projects.git
2. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to the project you want to work on.

3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.

4. Upload the project code to your Arduino board.

## Usage
Each project folder contains:

- The main .ino file with the Arduino code.
- A circuit diagrams and component lists.
- To use a project, navigate to its directory, open the .ino file in Arduino IDE, and upload it to your Arduino board.

## Contributing
